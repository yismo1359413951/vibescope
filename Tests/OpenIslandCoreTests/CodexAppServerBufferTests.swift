///
/// 1. A multi-line burst is parsed end-to-end and the buffer is fully drained
///    (the previous `Data(slice)` rebuild was O(N²) per line — switching to
///    `removeSubrange` keeps it O(N) total).
/// 2. A trailing partial line stays in the buffer, intact, awaiting more bytes.
/// 3. A runaway producer that never sends `\n` triggers the safety cap rather
///    than letting `readBuffer` grow without bound.
